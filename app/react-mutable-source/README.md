# Formik Integration Test App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

In order to run `mutable-source`, you must add the following to the root `package.json`. Be sure to leave in any other resolutions that exist.

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@types/react": "^17.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^17.0.0",
    "react": "0.0.0-experimental-27659559e",
    "react-dom": "0.0.0-experimental-27659559e"
  },
}
```

Then run `yarn` in the root directory.
